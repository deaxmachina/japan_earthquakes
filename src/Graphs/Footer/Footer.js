          This project was completed mainly as visualisation practice, but having seen the visual representation of the 
          comparison between earthquake magnitude and number of casualties raised interesting questions for me. Unfortunately, 
          I am hardly an earthquake expert, and thus I refrained from turning this into a more in-depth exploration of the 
          other factors at play. Some topics of interest for further exploration would be: depth and location of the earthquake,
          comparing the number of deaths caused by tsunami, versus fires versus the pure earthquake effects; improvements in infrastructure 
          and building standards over time in Japan; public preparedness (which has especially increased since the 2011 Tohoku disaster).
          I wish I could give these topics more attention, or as an academic would say, these are areas for future research.
